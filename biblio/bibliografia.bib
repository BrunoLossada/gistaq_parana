   abstract = {The new Sentinel-2 satellites present a significant scientific opportunity for the study of water quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the suitability of Sentinel-2 imagery for estimating and mapping Secchi disk transparency (SDT) in Río Tercero reservoir (Córdoba-Argentina). Field observations and a dataset of atmospherically corrected Sentinel-2 images were used to generate and validate an algorithm to estimate water clarity in the studied reservoir. As a real application of the used methodology, the validated algorithm was used to obtain a spatial representation of water clarity in the reservoir during sampling campaigns. Results demonstrate capabilities of Sentinel-2 mission to make a substantial contribution to the current assessment and understanding of aquatic systems by estimating and mapping a water quality characteristic.},

   abstract = {Transparency or turbidity is one of the main indicators in studies of water quality using remote sensing. Transparency can be measured in situ through the Secchi disc depth (SD), and turbidity using a turbidimeter. In recent decades, different relationships between bands from different remote sensing sensors have been used for the estimation of these variables. In this paper, several indices and spectral bands have been calibrated in order to estimate transparency from Sentinel-2 (S2) images from field data, obtained throughout 2017 and 2018 in Júcar basin reservoirs with a great variety of trophic states. Three atmospheric correction methods developed for waters have been applied to the S2 level L1C images taken at the same day as the field data: Polymer, C2RCC and C2X. From the spectra obtained from S2 and the SD field data, it has been found that the smallest error is obtained with the images atmospherically corrected with Polymer and a potential adjustment of the reflectivities’ ratio of the blue and green bands (R490/R560), which allow the estimation of SD with a relative error of 13%. Also the C2X method presents good adjustment with the same bands ratio, although with a greater error, while the correction C2RCC shows the worst correlation. The relationship between SD (in m) and turbidity (in NTU) has also been obtained, which provides an operational method for estimating turbidity with S2. The relationship for the different reservoirs between SD and chlorophyll-a concentration, suspended solids and dissolved organic matter, is also shown.},

   abstract = {Chlorophyll-a concentration and Secchi disk depth are two of the most important biophysical parameters used to assess water quality and determine the ecological state of inland waters. The Ocean Color 2 and Dall'Olmo three-band algorithms were used to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration and the calibration of the ratio 490/705 nm was used to produce an algorithm for estimating Secchi disk depth. These algorithms have been calibrated for the Sentinel 2-Multispectral Instrument (S2-MSI) and validated using in situ measurements of chlorophyll-a, Secchi disk depth and radiometry. This data was taken in the Valencia region reservoirs as part of the project Ecological Status of Aquatic Systems with Sentinel Satellites (ESAQS). The results show that for estimating chlorophyll-a concentration, it is better to apply a prior classification based on their trophic status. For eutrophic and hypertrophic waters, the TBDO algorithm had an error of 23 mg/m3 over a chlorophyll-a concentration range of between 10 to 169 mg/m3. For ultraoligotrophic to mesotrophic waters, the better algorithm was OC2_490, which resulted in an error equal to 0.9 mg/m3 over a chlorophyll-a concentration range of between 0.54 to 5.8 mg/m3. For the estimation of water transparency by Secchi disk depth, we have obtained good results with the ratio 490/705 nm, with an error equal to 0.88 m over a Secchi disk depth range of between 0.26 to 8.1 m. These algorithms have been applied to S2-MSI images and satisfactory results have been obtained for different reservoirs in the Valencia region (Spain).},

   abstract = {Water transparency is one of the ecological indicators for describing water quality and the underwater light field which determines its productivity. In the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) as well as in the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) water transparency is used for ecological status classification of inland, coastal and open sea waters and it is regarded as an indicator for eutrophication in Baltic Sea management (HELCOM, 2007). We developed and compared different empirical and semi-analytical algorithms for lakes and coastal Nordic waters to retrieve Secchi depth (ZSD) from remote sensing data (MERIS, 300 m resolution). The algorithms were developed in water bodies with high coloured dissolved organic matter absorption (aCDOM(442) ranging 1.7–4.0 m−1), Chl a concentration (0.5–73 mg m−3) and total suspended matter (0.7–37.5 g m−3) and validated against an independent data set over inland and coastal waters (0.6 m < ZSD < 14.8 m). The results indicate that for empirical algorithms, using longer wavelengths in the visible spectrum as a reference band decreases the RMSE and increases the coefficient of determination (R2). The accuracy increased (R2 = 0.75, RMSE = 1.33 m, n = 134) when ZSD was retrieved via an empirical relationship between ZSD and Kd(490). The best agreement with in situ data was attained when ZSD was calculated via both the diffuse and the beam attenuation coefficient (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.77 m, n = 89). The results demonstrate that transparency can be retrieved with high accuracy over various optical water types by the means of ocean color remote sensing, improving both the spatial and temporal coverage. The satellite derived ZSD product could be therefore used as an additional source of information for WFD and MSFD reporting purposes.},

   abstract = {This study investigated the use of frequent metre-scale resolution Pleiades satellite imagery to monitor water quality parameters in the highly turbid Gironde Estuary (GE, SW France). Pleiades satellite data were processed and analyzed in two representative test sites of the GE: 1) the maximum turbidity zone and 2) the mouth of the estuary. The main objectives of this study were to: (i) validate the Dark Spectrum Fitting (DSF) atmospheric correction developed by Vanhellemont and Ruddick (2018) applied to Pleiades satellite data recorded over the GE; (ii) highlight the benefits of frequent metre-scale Pleiades observations in highly turbid estuaries by comparing them to previously validated satellite observations made at medium (250/300 m for MODIS, MERIS, OLCI data) and high (20/30 m for SPOT, OLI and MSI data) spatial resolutions. The results show that the DSF allows for an accurate retrieval of water turbidity by inversion of the water reflectance in the near-infrared (NIR) and red wavebands. The difference between Pleiades-derived turbidity and field measurements was proven to be in the order of 10%. To evaluate the spatial variability of water turbidity at metre scale, Pleiades data at 2 m resolution were resampled to 20 m and 250 m to simulate typical coarser resolution sensors. On average, the derived spatial variability in the GE is lower than or equal to 10% and 26%, respectively, in 20-m and 250-m aggregated pixels. Pleiades products not only show, in great detail, the turbidity features in the estuary and river plume, they also allow to map the turbidity inside ports and capture the complex spatial variations of turbidity along the shores of the estuary. Furthermore, the daily acquisition capabilities may provide additional advantages over other satellite constellations when monitoring highly dynamic estuarine systems.},

   abstract = {Nowadays, space-borne imaging spectro-radiometers are exploited for many environmental applications, including water quality monitoring. Turbidity is a standout amongst the essential parameters of water quality that affect productivity. The current study aims to utilize Landsat 8 surface reflectance (L8SR) to retrieve turbidity in the Ramganga River, a tributary of the Ganges River. Samples of river water were collected from 16 different locations on 13 March and 27 November 2014. L8SR images from 6 March and 17 November 2014 were downloaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website. The algorithm to retrieve turbidity is based on the correlation between L8SR reflectance (single and ratio bands) and insitu data. The b2/b4 and b2/b3 bands ratio are proven to be the best predictors of turbidity, with R2 = 0.560 (p < 0.05) and R2 = 0.726 (p < 0.05) for March and November, respectively. Selected models are validated by comparing the concentrations of predicted and measured turbidity. The results showed that L8SR is a promising tool for monitoring surface water from space, even in relatively narrow river channels, such as the Ramganga River.},

   abstract = {Sentinel-2A/MSI (S2A) and Landsat-8/OLI (L8) data products present a new frontier for the assessment and retrieval of optically active water quality parameters including chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), suspended particulate matter (TSS), and turbidity in reservoirs. However, because of their differences in spatial and spectral samplings, it is critical to evaluate how well the sensors are suited for the seamless generation of the water quality parameters (WQPs). This study presents results from the retrieval of the WQP in a reservoir from L8 and S2A optical sensors, after atmospheric correction and standardization through band adjustment. An empirical multivariate regression model (EMRM) algorithmic approach is proposed for the estimation of the water quality parameters in correlation with in situ laboratory measurements. From the results, both sensors estimated Chl-a concentrations with R2 of greater than 70% from the visible green band for L8 and a combination of green and SWIR-1 bands for S2A. While the NMSE% was nearly the same for both sensors in Chl-a estimation, the RMSE was <10 μg/L and >10 μg/L for L8 and S2A estimations of Chl-a, respectively. For TSS retrieval, L8 outperformed S2A by 31% in accuracy with R2>0.9 from L8's red, blue, and green bands, as compared to 0.47≤R2≥0.61 from S2A's red and NIR bands. The RMSE were the same as for Chl-a, and the NMSE% were both in the same range. Both sensors retrieved turbidity with high and nearly equal accuracy of R2>70% from the visible and NIR bands, with equal RMSE at <10% NTU and NMAE% from S2A being higher by more than 30% as compared to L8's NMAE% at 15%. The study concluded that the higher performance accuracy of L8 is attributed to its higher SNR and spectral bandwidth placement as compared to S2A bands. Comparatively, S2A overestimated Chl-a and turbidity but performed equally well compared to OLI in the estimation of TSS. The results show that while absolute accuracy of retrieval of the WQPs still requires improvements, the developed algorithms are broadly able to discern the biooptical water quality in reservoirs.},

   abstract = {Turbidity is an important indicator of riverine conditions, especially in a fragile environment such as the Tibetan Plateau. Remote sensing, with the advantages of large-scale observations, has been widely applied to monitor turbidity change in lakes and rivers; however, few studies have focused on turbidity change of rivers on the Tibetan Plateau. We investigated the pattern of turbidity change in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, southern Tibetan Plateau, based on multispectral satellite imagery and in situ measurements. We developed empirical models from in situ measured water leaving reflectance and turbidity, and applied the best performed s-curve models on satellite imagery from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Landsat 5 to derive turbidity change in 2007–2017. Our results revealed an overall decreasing spatial trend from the upper to lower streams. Seasonal variations were observed with high turbidity from July to September and low turbidity from October to May. Annual turbidity showed a temporally slightly declining trend from 2007 to 2017. The pattern of turbidity change is affected by the confluence of tributaries and the changes in precipitation and vegetation along the river. These findings provide important insights into the responses of riverine turbidity to climate and environmental changes on the Tibetan Plateau.},

   abstract = {To restrict the entry of polluting components into water bodies, particularly rivers, it is critical to undertake timely monitoring and make rapid choices. Traditional techniques of assessing water quality are typically costly and time-consuming. With the advent of remote sensing technologies and the availability of high-resolution satellite images in recent years, a significant opportunity for water quality monitoring has arisen. In this study, the water quality index (WQI) for the Hudson River has been estimated using Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS images and four Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, such as M5 Model Tree (MT), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Gene Expression Programming (GEP), and Evolutionary Polynomial Regression (EPR). In this way, 13 water quality parameters (WQPs) (i.e., Turbidity, Sulfate, Sodium, Potassium, Hardness, Fluoride, Dissolved Oxygen, Chloride, Arsenic, Alkalinity, pH, Nitrate, and Magnesium) were measured between 14 March 2021 and 16 June 2021 at a site near Poughkeepsie, New York. First, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models were created between these WQPs parameters and the spectral indices of Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS images, and then, the most correlated spectral indices were selected as input variables of AI models. With reference to the measured values of WQPs, the WQI was determined according to the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) guidelines. After that, AI models were developed through the training and testing stages, and then estimated values of WQI were compared to the actual values. The results of the AI models’ performance showed that the MARS model had the best performance among the other AI models for monitoring WQI. The results demonstrated the high effectiveness and power of estimating WQI utilizing a combination of satellite images and artificial intelligence models.},

Satellite remote sensing technology, which has been used successfully to study surface water quality parameters for many years, could be very useful to study and monitor the quality of water in the Tennessee River. This study developed a numerical turbidity estimation model for the Tennessee River and its tributaries in Southeast Tennessee using Landsat 8 satellite imagery coupled with near real-time in situ measurements. The obtained results suggest that a nonlinear regression-based numerical model can be developed using Band 4 (red) surface reflectance values of the Landsat 8 OLI sensor to estimate turbidity in these water bodies with the potential of high accuracy. The accuracy assessment of the estimated turbidity achieved a coefficient of determination (R2) value and root mean square error (RMSE) as high as 0.97 and 1.41 NTU, respectively. The model was also tested on imagery acquired on a different date to assess its potential for routine remote estimation of turbidity and produced encouraging results with R2 value of 0.94 and relatively high RMSE.},

   abstract = {Monitoring water quality of inland lakes and reservoirs is a great concern for the public and government in China. Water turbidity is a reliable and direct indicator that can reflect the water quality. Remote sensing has become an efficient technology for monitoring large-scale water turbidity. This study aims to search an optimal regression model to accurately predict water turbidity using remote sensing data. To achieve this goal, 187 water samples were collected from field campaigns across Northeast China, in 2018, of which the samples were gathered within ±6 days of Sentinel-2 overpasses. The spectral reflectance data was used as independent variables for modeling. The simple regression, partial least squares regression, support vector regression, extreme learning machine, back-propagation neural network, classification and regression tree, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbor were used to compare. From model validation, we identified GBDT as the best regression model (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 9.90 NTU, MAE = 6.71 NTU). We applied GBDT to retrieve the water turbidity and obtained a satisfactory result. Feature selection technique from tree-based ensemble method was also tested. We selected B2, B3, B4, and B5 as the important variables because of their high ability to explain the variation of turbidity. These results demonstrated the significance of using a promising method to retrieve water turbidity using Sentinel-2 imagery at the regional scale. It is beneficial to monitor the spatial-temporal distribution of water turbidity; support water quality management and inland water environment protection.},
