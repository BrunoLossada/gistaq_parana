Remote sensing techniques have been widely used to measure the qualitative parameters of waterbodies (i.e., suspended sediments, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), chlorophyll-a, and pollutants). A large number of different sensors on board various satellites and other platforms, such as airplanes, are currently used to measure the amount of radiation at different wavelengths reflected from the water's surface. In this review paper, various properties (spectral, spatial and temporal, etc.) of the more commonly employed spaceborne and airborne sensors are tabulated to be used as a sensor selection guide. Furthermore, this paper investigates the commonly used approaches and sensors employed in evaluating and quantifying the eleven water quality parameters. The parameters include: chlorophyll-a (chl-a), colored dissolved organic matters (CDOM), Secchi disk depth (SDD), turbidity, total suspended sediments (TSS), water temperature (WT), total phosphorus (TP), sea surface salinity (SSS), dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD).},

  abstract = {Optical earth observation (EO) satellite sensors generally suffer from drifts and biases relative to their pre-launch calibration, caused by launch and/or time in the space environment. This places a severe limitation on the fundamental reliability and accuracy that can be assigned to satellite derived information, and is particularly critical for long time base studies for climate change and enabling interoperability and Analysis Ready Data. The proposed TRUTHS (Traceable Radiometry Underpinning Terrestrial and Helio-Studies) mission is explicitly designed to address this issue through re-calibrating itself directly to a primary standard of the international system of units (SI) in-orbit and then through the extension of this SI-traceability to other sensors through in-flight cross-calibration using a selection of Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) recommended test sites. Where the characteristics of the sensor under test allows, this will result in a significant improvement in accuracy. This paper describes a set of tools, algorithms and methodologies that have been developed and used in order to estimate the radiometric uncertainty achievable for an indicative target sensor through in-flight cross-calibration using a well-calibrated hyperspectral SI-traceable reference sensor with observational characteristics such as TRUTHS. In this study, Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) is evaluated as an example, however the analysis is readily translatable to larger-footprint sensors such as Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). This study considers the criticality of the instrumental and observational characteristics on pixel level reflectance factors, within a defined spatial region of interest (ROI) within the target site. It quantifies the main uncertainty contributors in the spectral, spatial, and temporal domains. The resultant tool will support existing sensor-to-sensor cross-calibration activities carried out under the auspices of CEOS, and is also being used to inform the design specifications for TRUTHS.},

  abstract = {The advancement in satellite remote sensing technology has revolutionised the approaches to monitoring the Earth's surface. The development of the Copernicus Programme by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Union (EU) has contributed to the effective monitoring of the Earth's surface by producing the Sentinel-2 multispectral products. Sentinel-2 satellites are the second constellation of the ESA Sentinel missions and carry onboard multispectral scanners. The primary objective of the Sentinel-2 mission is to provide high resolution satellite data for land cover/use monitoring, climate change and disaster monitoring, as well as complementing the other satellite missions such as Landsat. Since the launch of Sentinel-2 multispectral instruments in 2015, there have been many studies on land cover/use classification which use Sentinel-2 images. However, no review studies have been dedicated to the application of ESA Sentinel-2 land cover/use monitoring. Therefore, this review focuses on two aspects: (1) assessing the contribution of ESA Sentinel-2 to land cover/use classification, and (2) exploring the performance of Sentinel-2 data in different applications (e.g., forest, urban area and natural hazard monitoring). The present review shows that Sentinel-2 has a positive impact on land cover/use monitoring, specifically in monitoring of crop, forests, urban areas, and water resources. The contemporary high adoption and application of Sentinel-2 can be attributed to the higher spatial resolution (10 m) than other medium spatial resolution images, the high temporal resolution of 5 days and the availability of the red-edge bands with multiple applications. The ability to integrate Sentinel-2 data with other remotely sensed data, as part of data analysis, improves the overall accuracy (OA) when working with Sentinel-2 images. The free access policy drives the increasing use of Sentinel-2 data, especially in developing countries where financial resources for the acquisition of remotely sensed data are limited. The literature also shows that the use of Sentinel-2 data produces high accuracies ({$>$}80\%) with machine-learning classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) and Random forest (RF). However, other classifiers such as maximum likelihood analysis are also common. Although Sentinel-2 offers many opportunities for land cover/use classification, there are challenges which include mismatching with Landsat OLI-8 data, a lack of thermal bands, and the differences in spatial resolution among the bands of Sentinel-2. Sentinel-2 data show promise and have the potential to contribute significantly towards land cover/use monitoring.},

  abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems underpin global water and food security, yet are some of the most endangered ecosystems in the world because they are particularly vulnerable to land management change and climate variability. The US National Research Council's guidance to NASA regarding missions for the coming decade includes a polar orbiting, global mapping hyperspectral satellite remote sensing mission, the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI), to make quantitative measurements of ecosystem change. Traditionally, freshwater ecosystems have been challenging to measure with satellite remote sensing because they are small and spatially complex, require high fidelity spectroradiometry, and are best described with biophysical variables derived from high spectral resolution data. In this study, we evaluate the contribution of a hyperspectral global mapping satellite mission to measuring freshwater ecosystems. We demonstrate the need for such a mission, and evaluate the suitability and gaps, through an examination of the measurement resolution issues impacting freshwater ecosystem measurements (spatial, temporal, spectral and radiometric). These are exemplified through three case studies that use remote sensing to characterize a component of freshwater ecosystems that drive primary productivity. The high radiometric quality proposed for the HyspIRI mission makes it uniquely well designed for measuring freshwater ecosystems accurately at moderate to high spatial resolutions. The spatial and spectral resolutions of the HyspIRI mission are well suited for the retrieval of multiple biophysical variables, such as phycocyanin and chlorophyll-a. The effective temporal resolution is suitable for characterizing growing season wetland phenology in temperate regions, but may not be appropriate for tracking algal bloom dynamics, or ecosystem responses to extreme events in monsoonal regions. Global mapping missions provide the systematic, repeated measurements necessary to measure the drivers of freshwater biodiversity change. Archival global mapping missions with open access and free data policies increase end user uptake globally. Overall, an archival, hyperspectral global mapping mission uniquely meets the measurement requirements of multiple end users for freshwater ecosystem science and management.},

The objectives of this review were to analyze recent advances in water quality remote sensing and determine limitations of current systems, estimation methods, and suggest future improvements. To that end, we collected over 200 sets of water quality data including blue-green algae phycocyanin (BGA-PC), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), dissolved oxygen (DO), specific conductivity (SC), fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM), turbidity, and pollution-sediments from 2016 to 2018. The water quality data, generated from laboratory analysis of grab samples and in-situ real-time monitoring sensors distributed in eight lakes and rivers in Midwestern United States, were paired with synchronous proximal spectra, tripod-mounted hyperspectral imagery, and satellite data. The results showed that both proximal and satellite-based sensors have great potential to provide accurate estimate of optically active parameters, and remote sensing of non-optically active parameters may be indirectly estimated but still remains a challenge. Data-driven empirical approaches, i.e., deep learning outperformed the other competing methods, providing promising possibility for operational use of remote sensing in water quality monitoring and decision-making. As the first-time review of deep neural networks for water quality estimation, the paper concludes that anomaly detection utilizing multi-sensor data fusion and virtual constellation in cloud-computing is the most promising means for predicting impending water pollution outbreaks such as algal blooms.},

  abstract = {Although lakes cover a small fraction of the Earth's surface water, they provide critical ecosystem functions for both human and wildlife. However, with intensive human activities and/or climate changes, water quality of many freshwater lakes has been reported as declining in the past several decades. Considerable efforts have been dedicated in water quality monitoring using remotely sensed imagery; meanwhile the number of satellites has been increased dramatically. Those techniques firstly developed for the ocean applications named ``Ocean color'' were applied to the inland lake water. Unfortunately, the optical properties of the inland waters are much complex than the oceans, where the constituents' compositions, phytoplankton structures, and other optical complexity varies among different water bodies, making it difficult to develop a universal method to retrieval lake water quality parameters using remote sensing. In this chapter, an outline of the basic physics of lake remote sensing and the fundamentals of atmospheric correction are introduced. Then, we discuss some practical remote sensing methods for inland lake studies, including water/land delineation, total suspended sediments (TSS), and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) retrieval algorithms, as well as a novel method to obtain lake bathymetry.},

However, limited water quality records of a full river continuum hindered the understanding of how river systems response to the multiple stressors acting on them. This study highlights the use of Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) data to monitor changes in water color in two optically complex river systems: the Yangtze and Danube using the Forel-Ule Index (FUI). FUI divides water color into 21 classes from dark blue to yellowish brown stemming from the historical Forel-Ule water color scale and has been promoted as a useful indicator showing water turbidity variations in water bodies. The results revealed contrasting water color patterns in the two rivers on both spatial and seasonal scales. Spatially, the FUI of the Yangtze River gradually increased from the upper reaches to the lower reaches, while the FUI of the Danube River declined in the lower reaches, which is possibly due to the sediment sink effect of the Iron Gate Dams. The regional FUI peaks and valleys observed in the two river systems have also been shown to be related to the dams and hydropower stations along them. Seasonally, the variations of FUI in both systems can be attributed to climate seasonality, especially precipitation in the basin and the water level. Moreover, land cover within the river basin was possibly a significant determinant of water color, as higher levels of vegetation in the Danube basin were associated with lower FUI values, whereas higher FUI values and lower levels of vegetation were observed in the Yangtze system. This study furthers our knowledge of using Sentinel-2 MSI to monitor and understand the spatial-temporal variations of river systems and highlights the capabilities of the FUI in an optically complex environment.},

The Sentinel 2 platform offers greatly improved spatial resolution over other satellite platforms designed for water based chl-a retrievals and includes a ``red-edge'' band at 704 nm not present on the Landsat 8 operational land imager. This study provides validation of an improved version of a well known semi-analytical chl-a retrieval algorithm. The algorithm is provided with several free image processing utilities and the improved approach can be implemented with minimal technology skills. The improved performance is the result of replacing a fixed chl-a specific absorption coefficient (a*) with a variable model. This method was applied to three Sentinel 2 images taken over the Lake Erie western basin correlating with an in-situ dataset of 24 samples where chl-a ranged from 1.89 mg m-3 to 70.20 mg m-3. The variable a* model produced chl-a retrievals with normalised root mean squared error of prediction (NRMSEP) = 7.5\%, bias = -0.47 mg m-3, coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.91 and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) = 0.90). This represented a 23\% reduction in NRMSEP, an 85\% reduction in bias and an increase in NSE of 7\% over the default algorithm using a fixed a* value. Creation of chl-a retrieval algorithms that consider the variability in a* should result in algorithms that perform better against a wide range of chl-a concentrations and are less likely to require local recalibration. Obtaining accurate chl-a retrievals from a satellite platform with the spatial resolution of Sentinel 2 will allow satellite monitoring of many more inland waters than previously possible.},

  abstract = {As important components of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in an aquatic environment, colored DOM (CDOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) play an essential role in the carbon cycle of an inland aquatic system. Traditionally, CDOM and DOC in inland waters have been primarily determined using in situ observations and laboratory measurements. Most of past lake investigations on CDOM and DOC focused on easily accessible regions and covered a small fraction of lakes worldwide. To our knowledge, little is known about lakes in less accessible areas like the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). To address this challenge, optical satellite remote sensing might be useful for capturing a synoptic view of CDOM and DOC with high frequency at large scales, complementing in situ sampling methods for inland waters. In this study, 216 samples collected from 36 lakes across the QTP (2014--2017) were examined to determine the relationships between CDOM absorption coefficient at 350 nm (a350) and Sentinel-2A Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) imagery reflectance data. A strong positive linear correlation with a350 was observed with B4/B2 (R2 = 0.78, p {$<$} 0.01) and with B4/B3 (R2 = 0.62). A multi-step regression model was established for estimating a350 with B4/B2 and B4/B3 as input variables (R2 = 0.81, p {$<$} 0.01). A scattered CDOM-DOC relationship was revealed (R2 = 0.34, p {$<$} 0.05) using a pooled dataset. By dividing the inland waters into four separate groups in accordance with their salinity gradients, we were able to develop much stronger relationships (R2 {$>$} 0.8, p {$<$} 0.01) for CDOM-DOC. Significant differences between fresh and saline waters were demonstrated using satellite-derived CDOM and DOC, where high CDOM (0.86 {\textpm} 0.67 m-1) and low DOC (3.76 {\textpm} 4.92 mg L-1) concentrations were observed for freshwaters, while inverse trends of CDOM (0.53 {\textpm} 0.72 m-1) and DOC (15.76 {\textpm} 17.07 mg L-1) were demonstrated for saline lakes in the Tibetan Plateau. This study confirmed that satellite optical imagery can be used for the monitoring of CDOM and DOC of the lakes of the Tibetan Plateau, which are sensitive to a changing climate and are infrequently investigated due to the harsh environment and poor accessibility. Moreover, it highlighted the importance of combining salinity and remote sensing data in the process of estimating lake DOC.},

  abstract = {Water pollution has become one of the most serious issues threatening water environments, water as a resource and human health. The most urgent and effective measures rely on dynamic and accurate water quality monitoring on a large scale. Due to their temporal and spatial advantages, remote sensing technologies have been widely used to retrieve water quality data. With the development of hyper-spectral sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and artificial intelligence, there has been significant advancement in remotely sensed water quality retrieval owing to various data availabilities and retrieval methodologies. This article presents the application of remote sensing for water quality retrieval, and mainly discusses the research progress in terms of data sources and retrieval modes. In particular, we summarize some retrieval algorithms for several specific water quality variables, including total suspended matter (TSM), chlorophyll-a (Chl--a), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). We also discuss the significant challenges to atmospheric correction, remotely sensed data resolution, and retrieval model applicability in the domains of spatial, temporal and water complexity. Finally, we propose possible solutions to these challenges. The review can provide detailed references for future development and research in water quality retrieval.},

   abstract = {During the rainy season the abundance of mosquitoes over the Ferlo region (Senegal) is linked to dynamic, vegetation cover and turbidity of temporary and relatively small ponds. The latter create a variable environment where mosquitoes can thrive and thus contribute to diffusion and transmission of diseases such as the Rift Valley Fever (RVF, with Aedes vexans arabiensis and Culex poicilipes mosquitoes) in the Ferlo. The small size and complex distribution of ponds require the use of high-spatial resolution satellite images for adequate detection. Here the use of SPOT-5 images (10Â m-resolution) allows for detailed assessment of spatio-temporal evolution of ponds, through two new indices: i.e., the Normalized Difference Pond Index (NDPI), and the Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI). Small ponds less than 0.5Â ha dominate whatever the time period. For example they represent nearly 65% of the total ponds during the peak of the rainy season, up to 90% at the end of the same season. Moreover, another product is proposed: the Zone Potentially Occupied by Mosquitoes (ZPOM). During the apex of the summer monsoon, it is found that RVF mosquitoes occupy 25% of the Ferlo region, while only 0.9% of the same area is covered by ponds. Overlapping areas occupied by grazing cattle and mosquitoes, enhance RVF virus transmission. The remotely sensed operational indices and products presented here are meant to better understand the mechanisms at stake and to contribute to the development of early warning systems in a changing climate and environment.

   abstract = {We propose a normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI) to predict chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration from remote sensing data in estuarine and coastal turbid productive (case 2) waters. NDCI calibration and validation results derived from simulated and MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) datasets show its potential application to widely varying water types and geographic regions. A quadratic function (R 2=0.95, p<0.0001) accurately explained the variance in the simulated data for a chl-a range of 1-60mgm -3. Similarly a twofold calibration and validation of chl-a models using MERIS dataset, (chl-a range: 0.9-28.1mgm -3) yielded R 2 of 0.9, and RMSE of ~2mgm -3 respectively. NDCI was applied on images over the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay, the Mobile Bay, and the Mississippi River delta region in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The newly developed algorithm was successful in predicting chl-a concentration with approximately 12% overall bias for all above study regions. Findings from this research imply that NDCI can be successfully used on MERIS images to quantitatively monitor chl-a in inland coastal and estuarine waters. In case of remote coastal waters with no ground truth data, NDCI can be used to detect algal bloom and qualitatively infer chl-a concentration ranges very similar to NDVI's application in terrestrial vegetation studies.

   abstract = {Much effort has been applied in estimating the concentrations of chlorophyll-a (Chl a) in lakes. The optical complexity and lack of in situ data complicate estimating Chl a in such water bodies. We compared four established satellite reflectance algorithms-the two-band and three-band algorithms (2BDA, 3BDA), fluorescence line height (FLH), and normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI)-to estimate Chl a concentration in Lake Chad. We evaluated the performance and applicability of Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) images with the four Chl a estimation algorithms. For accuracy, we compared the concentration levels from the four algorithms to those from Worldview-3 (WV3) images. We identified two promising algorithms that could be used alongside L8 and S2 satellite images to monitor Chl a concentrations in Lake Chad. With an averaged R2 of 0.8, the 3BDA and NDCI Chl a algorithms performed accurately with S2 and L8 images. For the S2 and L8 images, 3BDA had the highest performance when compared to the WV3 estimates. We demonstrate the usefulness of sensor images in improving water quality information for areas that are difficult to access or when conventional data are limited.},

   abstract = {Although lakes cover a small fraction of the Earthâs surface water, they provide critical ecosystem functions for both human and wildlife. However, with intensive human activities and/or climate changes, water quality of many freshwater lakes has been reported as declining in the past several decades. Considerable efforts have been dedicated in water quality monitoring using remotely sensed imagery; meanwhile the number of satellites has been increased dramatically. Those techniques firstly developed for the ocean applications named âOcean colorâ were applied to the inland lake water. Unfortunately, the optical properties of the inland waters are much complex than the oceans, where the constituentsâ compositions, phytoplankton structures, and other optical complexity varies among different water bodies, making it difficult to develop a universal method to retrieval lake water quality parameters using remote sensing. In this chapter, an outline of the basic physics of lake remote sensing and the fundamentals of atmospheric correction are introduced. Then, we discuss some practical remote sensing methods for inland lake studies, including water/land delineation, total suspended sediments (TSS), and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) retrieval algorithms, as well as a novel method to obtain lake bathymetry.},

   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and proteinâprotein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-Î±-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â¤ 2.0 Ã for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

   abstract = {Transparency or turbidity is one of the main indicators in studies of water quality using remote sensing. Transparency can be measured in situ through the Secchi disc depth (SD), and turbidity using a turbidimeter. In recent decades, different relationships between bands from different remote sensing sensors have been used for the estimation of these variables. In this paper, several indices and spectral bands have been calibrated in order to estimate transparency from Sentinel-2 (S2) images from field data, obtained throughout 2017 and 2018 in JÃºcar basin reservoirs with a great variety of trophic states. Three atmospheric correction methods developed for waters have been applied to the S2 level L1C images taken at the same day as the field data: Polymer, C2RCC and C2X. From the spectra obtained from S2 and the SD field data, it has been found that the smallest error is obtained with the images atmospherically corrected with Polymer and a potential adjustment of the reflectivitiesâ ratio of the blue and green bands (R490/R560), which allow the estimation of SD with a relative error of 13%. Also the C2X method presents good adjustment with the same bands ratio, although with a greater error, while the correction C2RCC shows the worst correlation. The relationship between SD (in m) and turbidity (in NTU) has also been obtained, which provides an operational method for estimating turbidity with S2. The relationship for the different reservoirs between SD and chlorophyll-a concentration, suspended solids and dissolved organic matter, is also shown.},

   abstract = {Chlorophyll-a concentration and Secchi disk depth are two of the most important biophysical parameters used to assess water quality and determine the ecological state of inland waters. The Ocean Color 2 and Dall'Olmo three-band algorithms were used to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration and the calibration of the ratio 490/705 nm was used to produce an algorithm for estimating Secchi disk depth. These algorithms have been calibrated for the Sentinel 2-Multispectral Instrument (S2-MSI) and validated using in situ measurements of chlorophyll-a, Secchi disk depth and radiometry. This data was taken in the Valencia region reservoirs as part of the project Ecological Status of Aquatic Systems with Sentinel Satellites (ESAQS). The results show that for estimating chlorophyll-a concentration, it is better to apply a prior classification based on their trophic status. For eutrophic and hypertrophic waters, the TBDO algorithm had an error of 23 mg/m3 over a chlorophyll-a concentration range of between 10 to 169 mg/m3. For ultraoligotrophic to mesotrophic waters, the better algorithm was OC2_490, which resulted in an error equal to 0.9 mg/m3 over a chlorophyll-a concentration range of between 0.54 to 5.8 mg/m3. For the estimation of water transparency by Secchi disk depth, we have obtained good results with the ratio 490/705 nm, with an error equal to 0.88 m over a Secchi disk depth range of between 0.26 to 8.1 m. These algorithms have been applied to S2-MSI images and satisfactory results have been obtained for different reservoirs in the Valencia region (Spain).},

   abstract = {Water transparency is one of the ecological indicators for describing water quality and the underwater light field which determines its productivity. In the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) as well as in the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) water transparency is used for ecological status classification of inland, coastal and open sea waters and it is regarded as an indicator for eutrophication in Baltic Sea management (HELCOM, 2007). We developed and compared different empirical and semi-analytical algorithms for lakes and coastal Nordic waters to retrieve Secchi depth (ZSD) from remote sensing data (MERIS, 300 m resolution). The algorithms were developed in water bodies with high coloured dissolved organic matter absorption (aCDOM(442) ranging 1.7â4.0 mâ1), Chl a concentration (0.5â73 mg mâ3) and total suspended matter (0.7â37.5 g mâ3) and validated against an independent data set over inland and coastal waters (0.6 m < ZSD < 14.8 m). The results indicate that for empirical algorithms, using longer wavelengths in the visible spectrum as a reference band decreases the RMSE and increases the coefficient of determination (R2). The accuracy increased (R2 = 0.75, RMSE = 1.33 m, n = 134) when ZSD was retrieved via an empirical relationship between ZSD and Kd(490). The best agreement with in situ data was attained when ZSD was calculated via both the diffuse and the beam attenuation coefficient (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.77 m, n = 89). The results demonstrate that transparency can be retrieved with high accuracy over various optical water types by the means of ocean color remote sensing, improving both the spatial and temporal coverage. The satellite derived ZSD product could be therefore used as an additional source of information for WFD and MSFD reporting purposes.},

   abstract = {This study investigated the use of frequent metre-scale resolution Pleiades satellite imagery to monitor water quality parameters in the highly turbid Gironde Estuary (GE, SW France). Pleiades satellite data were processed and analyzed in two representative test sites of the GE: 1) the maximum turbidity zone and 2) the mouth of the estuary. The main objectives of this study were to: (i) validate the Dark Spectrum Fitting (DSF) atmospheric correction developed by Vanhellemont and Ruddick (2018) applied to Pleiades satellite data recorded over the GE; (ii) highlight the benefits of frequent metre-scale Pleiades observations in highly turbid estuaries by comparing them to previously validated satellite observations made at medium (250/300 m for MODIS, MERIS, OLCI data) and high (20/30 m for SPOT, OLI and MSI data) spatial resolutions. The results show that the DSF allows for an accurate retrieval of water turbidity by inversion of the water reflectance in the near-infrared (NIR) and red wavebands. The difference between Pleiades-derived turbidity and field measurements was proven to be in the order of 10%. To evaluate the spatial variability of water turbidity at metre scale, Pleiades data at 2 m resolution were resampled to 20 m and 250 m to simulate typical coarser resolution sensors. On average, the derived spatial variability in the GE is lower than or equal to 10% and 26%, respectively, in 20-m and 250-m aggregated pixels. Pleiades products not only show, in great detail, the turbidity features in the estuary and river plume, they also allow to map the turbidity inside ports and capture the complex spatial variations of turbidity along the shores of the estuary. Furthermore, the daily acquisition capabilities may provide additional advantages over other satellite constellations when monitoring highly dynamic estuarine systems.},

L8SR images from 6 March and 17 November 2014 were downloaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website. The algorithm to retrieve turbidity is based on the correlation between L8SR reflectance (single and ratio bands) and insitu data. The b2/b4 and b2/b3 bands ratio are proven to be the best predictors of turbidity, with R2 = 0.560 (p < 0.05) and R2 = 0.726 (p < 0.05) for March and November, respectively. Selected models are validated by comparing the concentrations of predicted and measured turbidity. The results showed that L8SR is a promising tool for monitoring surface water from space, even in relatively narrow river channels, such as the Ramganga River.},

   abstract = {Sentinel-2A/MSI (S2A) and Landsat-8/OLI (L8) data products present a new frontier for the assessment and retrieval of optically active water quality parameters including chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), suspended particulate matter (TSS), and turbidity in reservoirs. However, because of their differences in spatial and spectral samplings, it is critical to evaluate how well the sensors are suited for the seamless generation of the water quality parameters (WQPs). This study presents results from the retrieval of the WQP in a reservoir from L8 and S2A optical sensors, after atmospheric correction and standardization through band adjustment. An empirical multivariate regression model (EMRM) algorithmic approach is proposed for the estimation of the water quality parameters in correlation with in situ laboratory measurements. From the results, both sensors estimated Chl-a concentrations with R2 of greater than 70% from the visible green band for L8 and a combination of green and SWIR-1 bands for S2A. While the NMSE% was nearly the same for both sensors in Chl-a estimation, the RMSE was <10 Î¼g/L and >10 Î¼g/L for L8 and S2A estimations of Chl-a, respectively. For TSS retrieval, L8 outperformed S2A by 31% in accuracy with R2>0.9 from L8's red, blue, and green bands, as compared to 0.47â¤R2â¥0.61 from S2A's red and NIR bands. The RMSE were the same as for Chl-a, and the NMSE% were both in the same range. Both sensors retrieved turbidity with high and nearly equal accuracy of R2>70% from the visible and NIR bands, with equal RMSE at <10% NTU and NMAE% from S2A being higher by more than 30% as compared to L8's NMAE% at 15%. The study concluded that the higher performance accuracy of L8 is attributed to its higher SNR and spectral bandwidth placement as compared to S2A bands. Comparatively, S2A overestimated Chl-a and turbidity but performed equally well compared to OLI in the estimation of TSS. The results show that while absolute accuracy of retrieval of the WQPs still requires improvements, the developed algorithms are broadly able to discern the biooptical water quality in reservoirs.},

   abstract = {Turbidity is an important indicator of riverine conditions, especially in a fragile environment such as the Tibetan Plateau. Remote sensing, with the advantages of large-scale observations, has been widely applied to monitor turbidity change in lakes and rivers; however, few studies have focused on turbidity change of rivers on the Tibetan Plateau. We investigated the pattern of turbidity change in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, southern Tibetan Plateau, based on multispectral satellite imagery and in situ measurements. We developed empirical models from in situ measured water leaving reflectance and turbidity, and applied the best performed s-curve models on satellite imagery from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Landsat 5 to derive turbidity change in 2007â2017. Our results revealed an overall decreasing spatial trend from the upper to lower streams. Seasonal variations were observed with high turbidity from July to September and low turbidity from October to May. Annual turbidity showed a temporally slightly declining trend from 2007 to 2017. The pattern of turbidity change is affected by the confluence of tributaries and the changes in precipitation and vegetation along the river. These findings provide important insights into the responses of riverine turbidity to climate and environmental changes on the Tibetan Plateau.},

   abstract = {To restrict the entry of polluting components into water bodies, particularly rivers, it is critical to undertake timely monitoring and make rapid choices. Traditional techniques of assessing water quality are typically costly and time-consuming. With the advent of remote sensing technologies and the availability of high-resolution satellite images in recent years, a significant opportunity for water quality monitoring has arisen. In this study, the water quality index (WQI) for the Hudson River has been estimated using Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS images and four Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, such as M5 Model Tree (MT), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Gene Expression Programming (GEP), and Evolutionary Polynomial Regression (EPR). In this way, 13 water quality parameters (WQPs) (i.e., Turbidity, Sulfate, Sodium, Potassium, Hardness, Fluoride, Dissolved Oxygen, Chloride, Arsenic, Alkalinity, pH, Nitrate, and Magnesium) were measured between 14 March 2021 and 16 June 2021 at a site near Poughkeepsie, New York. First, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models were created between these WQPs parameters and the spectral indices of Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS images, and then, the most correlated spectral indices were selected as input variables of AI models. With reference to the measured values of WQPs, the WQI was determined according to the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) guidelines. After that, AI models were developed through the training and testing stages, and then estimated values of WQI were compared to the actual values. The results of the AI modelsâ performance showed that the MARS model had the best performance among the other AI models for monitoring WQI. The results demonstrated the high effectiveness and power of estimating WQI utilizing a combination of satellite images and artificial intelligence models.},

   abstract = {The Tennessee River in the United States is one of the most ecologically distinct rivers in the world and serves as a great resource for local residents. However, it is also one of the most polluted rivers in the world, and a leading cause of this pollution is storm water runoff. Satellite remote sensing technology, which has been used successfully to study surface water quality parameters for many years, could be very useful to study and monitor the quality of water in the Tennessee River. This study developed a numerical turbidity estimation model for the Tennessee River and its tributaries in Southeast Tennessee using Landsat 8 satellite imagery coupled with near real-time in situ measurements. The obtained results suggest that a nonlinear regression-based numerical model can be developed using Band 4 (red) surface reflectance values of the Landsat 8 OLI sensor to estimate turbidity in these water bodies with the potential of high accuracy. The accuracy assessment of the estimated turbidity achieved a coefficient of determination (R2) value and root mean square error (RMSE) as high as 0.97 and 1.41 NTU, respectively. The model was also tested on imagery acquired on a different date to assess its potential for routine remote estimation of turbidity and produced encouraging results with R2 value of 0.94 and relatively high RMSE.},

   abstract = {Monitoring water quality of inland lakes and reservoirs is a great concern for the public and government in China. Water turbidity is a reliable and direct indicator that can reflect the water quality. Remote sensing has become an efficient technology for monitoring large-scale water turbidity. This study aims to search an optimal regression model to accurately predict water turbidity using remote sensing data. To achieve this goal, 187 water samples were collected from field campaigns across Northeast China, in 2018, of which the samples were gathered within Â±6 days of Sentinel-2 overpasses. The spectral reflectance data was used as independent variables for modeling. The simple regression, partial least squares regression, support vector regression, extreme learning machine, back-propagation neural network, classification and regression tree, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbor were used to compare. From model validation, we identified GBDT as the best regression model (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 9.90 NTU, MAE = 6.71 NTU). We applied GBDT to retrieve the water turbidity and obtained a satisfactory result. Feature selection technique from tree-based ensemble method was also tested. We selected B2, B3, B4, and B5 as the important variables because of their high ability to explain the variation of turbidity. These results demonstrated the significance of using a promising method to retrieve water turbidity using Sentinel-2 imagery at the regional scale. It is beneficial to monitor the spatial-temporal distribution of water turbidity; support water quality management and inland water environment protection.},

   abstract = {Lakes play a crucial role in the earthâs ecosystems and human activities. While turbidity is not a direct biochemical indicator of lake water quality, it is relatively easy to measure and indicates trophic status and lake health. Although ocean color satellites have been widely used to monitor water color parameters, their coarse spatial resolution makes it hard to capture the fine spatial variability of turbidity in lakes. The combination of Sentinel-2 and Landsat provides an opportunity to monitor lake turbidity with high spatial and temporal resolution. This study aims to generate consistent turbidity products in Taihu Lake from 2018 to 2022 using the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) on board Sentinel-2A/B and the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on board Landsat-8/9. We first tested the performance of three atmospheric correction methods to retrieve consistent reflectance from MSI and OLI images. We found that the Rayleigh correction and a subtraction of the SWIR band from Rayleigh-corrected reflectance can generate the most consistent reflectance (the coefficient of determination (R2) > 0.84, the mean absolution percentage error (MAPE) < 7%, the median error (ME) < 0.0035, and slope > 0.92). Machine learning models outperformed an existing semi-analytical retrieval algorithm in retrieving turbidity (MSI: R2 = 0.92, MAPE = 18.78%, and OLI: R2 = 0.93, MAPE = 16.20%). The consistency of turbidity from the same-day MSI and OLI images was also satisfactory (N = 3110 and MAPE = 26.48%). The distribution of turbidity exhibited obvious spatial and seasonal variability in Taihu Lake from 2018 to 2022. The results show the potential of MSI and OLI when combined to monitor inland lake water quality.},

   abstract = {With the development of industrialization and urbanization, the consumption and pollution of water resources are becoming more and more serious. Water quality monitoring is an extremely important technical means to protect water resources. However, the current popular water quality monitoring methods have their shortcomings, such as a low signal-to-noise ratio of satellites, poor time continuity of unmanned aerial vehicles, and frequent maintenance of in situ underwater probes. A non-contact near-surface system that can continuously monitor water quality fluctuation is urgently needed. This study proposes an automatic near-surface water quality monitoring system, which can complete the physical equipment construction, data collection, and processing of the application scenario, prove the feasibility of the self-developed equipment and methods and obtain high-performance retrieval results of four water quality parameters, namely chemical oxygen demand (COD), turbidity, ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N), and dissolved oxygen (DO). For each water quality parameter, fourteen machine learning algorithms were compared and evaluated with five assessment indexes. Because the ensemble learning models combine the prediction results of multiple basic learners, they have higher robustness in the prediction of water quality parameters. The optimal determination coefficients ((Formula presented.)) of COD, turbidity, NH3-N, and DO in the test dataset are 0.92, 0.98, 0.95, and 0.91, respectively. The results show the superiority of near-surface remote sensing, which has potential application value in inland, coastal, and various water bodies in the future.},
